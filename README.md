# Real-Estate - Capstone Project
- The objective of the project was to :  
1. Identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.  
2. Create a model to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate  
- The train & test dataset contains 27321 & 11709 observations respectively of 80 variables.  

# Steps performed in this project:  
1. Data Description  
2. Data Exploration  
3. Data Preparation & Analysis  
- Duplicate Value treatment, Missing Value Treatment, Unnecessary columns removal from the dataset are performed.  
- Top 2500 Highest Second Mortgage Locations:

### Summary
In this project I have achieved an adjusted R Squared value of 98.8% which is pretty close to 1, indicating our selected "Independent Variablesâ€œ are highly correlated to our "Dependent Variable" and our model is able to predict very accurately.
